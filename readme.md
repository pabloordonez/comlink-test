# Comlink Test

This is initial test of Comlink as library, and web workers as a general tool to free the main
thread form complex tasks.

The test so far doesn't show any considerable improvements in terms of speed, but a lot of
difference in cpu usage.

# How to run the example

```sh
$ npm start
```
